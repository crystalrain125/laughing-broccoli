### Editting Core code
Source: Tulasi\
Core code is all of the code that has **nothing** to do with UCLA. \
Code that is under local/ucla or theme/ucla** is our **custom code**\
Surround your change with START/END UCLA MOD: CCLE-# comments\
**Remember** that all comments must end with a **period.**
```
// START UCLA MOD: CCLE-8459 - Messaging does not email students.
