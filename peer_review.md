# Peer Review
[Moodle Peer Review Guide](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Peer_reviewing)
- Does it make sense? Like, are there any [WTF moments](http://thedailywtf.com/). 
  - If it doesn't make sense, would additional comments help? If so, mention it. Or suggest a better method of doing something.
- Does it pass the [coding rules](cooking_rules.md#coding-rules)?
- Are things being done in a efficient/clear way?
- Criticize the code, not the programmer. There are many different ways to program something. Unless something is inherently wrong with the way a programmer implemented a feature, try to understand why they did something in a particular way before criticizing it.
